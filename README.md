# HTTP(S) Integration

## Overview

**HTTP(S)** is a ubiquitous, protocol-agnostic transport layer for accessing content over the web.
This integration allows a Kloset repository to be backed by a remote HTTP-based object store or content endpoint that exposes read/write operations over standard HTTP(S).
This integration allows:

* **Storing a Kloset repository on an HTTP-accessible storage endpoint:**
  Use any compatible HTTP/HTTPS server or service as a remote backend for Kloset.
  Ideal for custom object stores, static web servers, or self-hosted APIs with PUT/GET semantics.

* **Stateless and protocol-agnostic storage integration:**
  No client-specific agent or protocol extensions are required â€” repository objects are addressed via standard HTTP methods using content hashes.

* **Compatibility with custom cloud gateways and CDN-backed object layers:**
  Useful in advanced setups involving reverse proxies, serverless gateways, or content distribution networks exposing HTTP-backed object storage.

## Configuration

The configuration parameters are as follow:
- `location` (required): The URL of the HTTP endpoint (e.g., http://example.com/data)

> **Note:** The location can be write directly in the command, with `http://` or `https://` prefix.

## Examples

```bash
# create the kloset store
$ plakar at http://example.com/data create

# backup in the store
$ plakar at http://example.com/data backup /tmp
```
